## Overview
`elm-i18next-gen` is a tool for handling internationalization in Elm projects. It combines type safety with dynamic
translation loading, allowing for a smoother translation process and smaller bundles than existing solutions, while
maintaining type safety.

This tool generates code which uses the [elm-i18next](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ChristophP/elm-i18next/latest)
package to read text values from a source JSON object. If a change is made to the source JSON object `elm-i18next-gen`
ensures the corresponding change required in the code is found at compile-time, not at runtime. This means you don't need
to worry about translations being out-of-sync with the code.


## Installation
```sh
npm install --save-dev elm-i18next-gen
```

## Usage
See [documentation in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/yonigibbs/elm-i18next-gen#code-generation-for-elm-i18next) for
information on how to use this tool.
